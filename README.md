------------------
To develop a Voice AI System with the specified functionalities, including natural Australian female voice interactions, intelligent routing, emergency call handling, contractor management, and integration with different systems (e.g., Odoo v17, Office 365/Outlook, Zoom Phone, Mable.com.au), you will need a combination of various technologies. Below is a high-level Python program structure to demonstrate how you might approach developing this system. The code involves integrating Voice AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), RPA (Robotic Process Automation), call routing, and system integrations.
Key Components:

    Voice AI Development: Using a service like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech or Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services for a natural Australian female voice.
    Intelligent Routing: Handling inbound calls with different routing options based on keywords or tasks.
    Call Handling and Handover: Allowing seamless handover to human agents when required.
    API Integrations: Integration with external systems (Odoo v17, Office 365, Mable.com.au).
    RPA for Contractor Management: Automated job postings, contractor vetting, and credential verification.
    Real-Time Monitoring and Analytics: Monitoring call volumes, response times, etc.

Prerequisites:

    Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API or Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services for the voice synthesis.
    Twilio or Zoom Phone API for handling inbound and outbound calls.
    Odoo API for integration with the Odoo system.
    RPA Library like Robot Framework or UIPath for automating job postings and contractor vetting.

Required Libraries:

pip install google-cloud-texttospeech twilio requests

Example Python Code for Voice AI System:

Key Features:

    Voice AI (Text-to-Speech): Using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech to generate natural-sounding speech for the Australian female voice. This is used for inbound call responses, providing human-like interactions.
    Inbound Call Handling: Routes incoming calls based on task types like sales inquiries, service scheduling, or emergency situations.
    Outbound Communication: This system can be used to automatically send emails and make automated calls for tasks like contractor recruitment or wellness checks.
    RPA for Contractor Management: Posts jobs to Mable.com.au, vets contractors, and performs tasks like price negotiation and credential verification.
    Emergency Response Handling: Specialized function for dealing with emergency situations by routing calls to human agents or triggering predefined protocols.
    API Integration: Integrates with external APIs like Mable.com.au, Office 365, and a custom phone system (Twilio or Zoom Phone).

Customization:

    Voice AI: You can customize the voice type or language by changing the parameters in the synthesize_speech() function.
    Task Handling: Add more conditions for different tasks (e.g., appointment scheduling, service modification).
    APIs: Replace the placeholders with actual API endpoints for Mable.com.au, Odoo, Zoom Phone, or Office 365.

Next Steps:

    Testing: Test the system with real calls and integrate it with actual APIs.
    Monitoring and Analytics: Add a monitoring system to track call volumes and analyze performance.
    Scaling: Ensure the system is scalable, supporting higher volumes of calls, and adding more agents or tasks as required.

This example provides a foundational framework to build a Voice AI-powered system that integrates with Odoo, Mable, and other services, automating various tasks with AI.
